# Introduction
Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming the best play from both players. If tic-tac-toe were as simple as it seems, then why has it been around for over 3,000 years? The particular JavaScript version of the game has evolved a bit since the original version by letting two kids play online from their computers. From an educational point of view, this classic game contributes to children's development and growth in numerous ways, including their understanding of predictability, problem-solving, spatial reasoning, hand-eye coordination, turn-taking, and strategizing. The purpose of the project is to create a website called "Tic-tac-toe" that serves as an educational game and learning tool. The project aims to provide users with a trustworthy, safe, effective, and interactive platform. Two users are invited to follow the game instructions, then experiment, play for as long as they want, keep their scores, learn, and have fun. Moreover, the user interface UI is entertaining, free to play, and priceless to learn. <a href="https://evapalatou.github.io/tic-tac-toe-2" target="_blank">The website can be accessed HERE!</a>
